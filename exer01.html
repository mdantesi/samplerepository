        <p> Favorite CMSC Subject so far: I'd have to go with CMSC130 solely because of the fact that it was mainly handwritten and a learned a lot of practical logic.</p>
        <p> Favorite GE so far: This would have to go to ARTS1 because it allowed me to do something I enjoy and that is to read and to analyze.</p>
        <p> Favorite Programming Language: Definitely Python because it was my very first experience to the coding scene.</p>
        <p> Favorite Food: Pizza, defintely my comfort food and just eating it after a long day is pure bliss.</p>
